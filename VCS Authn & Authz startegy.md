## Introduction

Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git play a crucial role in modern software development. As teams scale, ensuring secure and controlled access through Authentication (Authn) and Authorization (Authz) is essential to protect code integrity and support collaboration.

---

## Why VCS Design is Important

An effective VCS Authn & Authz strategy helps to:

| Benefit         | Description                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
|  Security     | Protects code from unauthorized access.    |
| Accountability | Tracks who made what changes.            |
|  Scalability  | Enables structured collaboration.          |
|  Productivity | Reduces confusion and accidental overwrites. |
|  Auditing     | Helps during code reviews and compliance checks. |

---

##  Access Levels

| Role         | Description                                | Typical Permissions              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Admin        | Full control over repositories and settings| Read, Write, Merge, Manage Teams |
| Maintainer   | Manages repo structure and reviews         | Read, Write, Merge               |
| Developer    | Writes and pushes code                     | Read, Write                      |
| Reporter     | Reads code and issues                      | Read Only                        |
| Guest        | Limited visibility                         | Limited Read                     |

Access control can be applied:

- Per Branch  
- Per Repository  
- Per Group / Team

##  Audit Trails

| Event                      | Captured Information                        |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Code pushes                | User ID, timestamp, branch, commit hash     |
| Merge Requests / PRs       | Author, reviewers, approval status          |
| Branch permission changes  | Actor, affected branch, time                |
| Access changes             | Who changed access for whom and when        |

Stored in:
- Git logs
- VCS platform logs (GitHub/GitLab)
- External SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK)

##  Integration with Identity Providers

| Identity Provider  | Integration Method     | Benefits                         |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| LDAP / AD          | SAML, OAuth            | Centralized user management      |
| Okta               | SAML / SCIM            | Auto provisioning & deactivation |
| Google Workspace   | OAuth2                 | Simplified login, SSO            |
| Azure AD           | SAML / OpenID Connect  | Role-based access control        |

---

##  Advantages

| Advantage             | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|  Centralized Control| Unified place for managing code access          |
|  Time Efficiency    | Automated workflows reduce admin overhead       |
|  Compliance Ready   | Supports audit and regulatory requirements       |
|  Security First     | Fine-grained permissions per project/team        |
|  Team Collaboration | Supports branching strategies & workflows     |

---

##  Disadvantages

| Disadvantage         | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|  Setup Complexity  | Integrating with IdPs requires initial effort    |
|  Overhead          | Too much restriction may slow down collaboration|
|  Cost              | Premium features like SAML/SSO cost extra       |
|  Learning Curve    | New users may find RBAC and audit logs confusing|

---

##  Best Practices

| Practice                          | Description                             |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|  Enforce MFA                    | Add another layer of security           |
|  Disable Direct Push to Main   | Use protected branches                  |
|  Enable Code Review Workflow    | Require approval before merge           |
|  Regularly Audit Access         | Remove stale or unused accounts         |
|  Use Personal Access Tokens     | For CLI usage instead of passwords      |
|  Monitor Audit Logs             | Regular review for anomalies            |

---

##  Branch Access Policies

| Branch        | Access Rule                  | Description                          |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| main/master   | Protected (No direct push)   | Only merge via approved PRs/MRs      |
| develop       | Developers can push          | Used for integration/testing         |
| feature/*     | Only creator can push        | Isolated development branches        |
| release/*     | Restricted to Maintainers    | For code stabilization               |
| hotfix/*      | Maintainers only             | Critical issue resolution            |

---

## Conclusion

A well-designed **Authn & Authz** strategy in VCS ensures secure, auditable, and efficient collaboration.  
We recommend adopting **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **SSO** with audit logging for all production-level repositories.
