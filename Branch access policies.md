## 1. Introduction

Branch access policies refer to the rules and restrictions enforced on branches within version control systems like Git. These policies help protect important branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`) from accidental changes, enforce code review processes, and standardize team workflows.

---

## 2. Why Branch Access Policies Matter

Unrestricted branch access can lead to unreviewed code, broken builds, or security issues. Branch access policies help:

- Enforce review and testing processes
- Prevent force pushes and direct commits
- Ensure build success before merging
- Protect production-critical code

## 3. Branch Protection Rules

| Rule                            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Require Pull Request Reviews** | Code must be reviewed before merging to protected branches.                 |
| **Require Status Checks**        | CI tests must pass before merging.                                          |
| **Restrict Pushes**              | Only specific users or teams can push to protected branches.                |
| **Require Signed Commits**       | Only commits with verified GPG signatures are allowed.                      |
| **Prevent Force Pushes**         | Disables force pushes to avoid overwriting history.                         |
| **Prevent Deletions**            | Protects critical branches from being deleted.                              |

## 4. Access Policies

| Policy Type               | Description                                                                |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Role-Based Access**     | Permissions are based on roles (e.g., Admin, Maintainer, Developer).       |
| **Team-Based Access**     | Access rights assigned to user groups or teams.                            |
| **Environment Rules**     | Restrict who can deploy or merge into environment-specific branches.       |
| **Code Owner Enforcement**| Requires designated owners to review changes to specific files/paths.       |

---

## 5. Workflow Controls

| Control Feature              | Description                                                               |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linear History Requirement** | Prevents merge commits and enforces rebase workflow.                     |
| **Auto-Merge Settings**       | Allows merging PRs automatically once all checks pass.                    |
| **Draft Pull Requests**       | Allows work-in-progress PRs without triggering reviews or actions.        |
| **Lock Branch**               | Temporarily disables all changes to a branch.                             |

## 6. Advantages

| Benefit                       | Description                                                               |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Improved Code Quality**     | Ensures peer review and automated checks are performed.                   |
| **Increased Security**        | Restricts who can make changes to critical branches.                      |
| **Stable Main Branch**        | Prevents breaking changes from entering production codebases.             |
| **Audit Trail**               | Keeps history of who made changes and who approved them.                  |

## 7. Disadvantages

| Drawback                      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Setup Complexity**  | Requires careful planning and configuration for teams and roles.           |
| **Reduced Flexibility**       | May slow down development in fast-paced teams if too strict.               |
| **Access Bottlenecks**        | Merges may be delayed if reviewers or approvers are unavailable.           |
| **Onboarding Overhead**       | New team members need to be trained on protected branch policies.          |

## 8. Best Practices

| Best Practice                    | Description                                                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Protect Key Branches**         | Apply strict rules to `main`, `release`, and `production` branches.      |
| **Enforce Reviews**              | Require at least 1â€“2 reviewers for every pull request.                   |
| **Use Status Checks**            | Integrate CI/CD pipelines with branch protection.                        |
| **Restrict Write Access**        | Allow direct push only for automation or authorized users.               |
| **Document Policies Clearly**    | Make policies visible and understandable to all contributors.            |
| **Enable Required Commit Signing** | Add commit verification via GPG for authenticity.                      |

## 9. Conclusion

Branch access policies are essential for maintaining a secure, high-quality, and collaborative development environment. They reduce the risk of errors, enforce process discipline, and ensure teams deliver reliable code to production.

 **Recommended Practice:** Protect the `main` and `release` branches with enforced PR reviews, CI status checks, and restricted write access for all team projects.
