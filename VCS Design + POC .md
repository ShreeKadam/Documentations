## Introduction

Version Control System (VCS) design ensures teams can collaborate on source code efficiently, maintaining history, auditability, and security.

## Why VCS Design is Important

| Purpose                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code Collaboration**   | Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase.                   |
| **History Tracking**     | Maintains commit logs and version changes.                                  |
| **Auditability**         | Helps trace actions to individual users or commits.                         |
| **Disaster Recovery**    | Allows rollback in case of system failure or bugs.                          |

---

## Advantages

| Benefit                  | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Isolation of Work**    | Prevents incomplete or buggy code from affecting main branch. |
| **Code Review Friendly** | Allows easy peer review through Pull Requests.                |
| **Task Focused**         | Developers can focus on one feature at a time.                |
| **CI/CD Friendly**       | Integrates well with automated testing pipelines.             |
| **Easy Rollbacks**       | Changes can be reverted using history and tags.               |

| **Required Reviewers**   | Enforce minimum number of code reviewers before merge.                       |
| **Status Checks**        | Block merges unless all CI checks pass.                                     |
| **Signed Commits**       | Require GPG-signed commits for authenticity.                                |

## Conclusion

A well-planned VCS design ensures secure collaboration, code quality, and compliance. Following access policies, integrating with identity providers, and auditing activities are essential pillars of enterprise-grade development workflows.
