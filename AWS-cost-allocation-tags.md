## Introduction

AWS Cost Allocation Tags help you track and manage costs in a granular way. By attaching metadata to AWS resources, tags enable accurate cost tracking by project, department, environment, and more. They are essential for cost transparency, chargebacks, and budgeting.

## What are AWS Cost Allocation Tags?

Cost Allocation Tags are **key-value pairs** assigned to AWS resources. AWS uses these tags to **organize usage costs** across different dimensions (e.g., teams, workloads).

There are **two types**:
- **AWS-generated tags**: Automatically created by AWS (e.g., `aws:createdBy`).
- **User-defined tags**: Created and managed by users (e.g., `Project: ML-App`).

##  Best Practices

| Best Practice                        | Description                                                                 |

| **Use Automation**                  | Enforce tags with AWS Config, Service Control Policies, or Lambda functions |
| **Regular Audits**                  | Periodically verify tag coverage with AWS Tag Editor and reports           |
| **Limit Number of Tags**            | Keep tag keys manageable to avoid confusion                                |
| **Enable Tags for Cost Allocation** | Manually activate each tag for cost tracking in the Billing Console        |
