## 1. Introduction

The **Feature Branch Workflow** is a Git-based development strategy where each new feature is developed in its own branch, isolated from the `main` or `production` codebase. It allows developers to work independently without interfering with the stable codebase.

---

## 2. Why Feature Branch Workflow?

Feature branching provides a clean way to manage different streams of development while maintaining a stable main branch. It encourages collaboration and code reviews through pull requests and ensures features are tested before they’re merged.

###  Comparison Table

| Criteria               | Feature Branch Workflow       | Trunk-Based Development      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Isolation              | High                          | Low                          |
| Collaboration          | Moderate to High              | High                         |
| Risk of Conflicts      | Low (if regularly rebased)    | Higher                       |
| Code Review Friendly   | Yes                         |  Limited                   |

## 4. Advantages

| Benefit                  | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Isolation of Work**    | Prevents incomplete or buggy code from affecting main branch. |
| **Code Review Friendly** | Allows easy peer review through Pull Requests.                |
| **Task Focused**         | Developers can focus on one feature at a time.                |
| **CI/CD Friendly**       | Integrates well with automated testing pipelines.             |

## 5. Disadvantages

| Limitation                | Impact                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Merge Conflicts**       | May arise if branches diverge too much.                                     |
| **Long-Lived Branches**   | Can lead to integration hell.                                               |
| **Dependency Management** | Features dependent on others may require rebasing or temporary workarounds. |

---
## 6. Conclusion

**Feature Branch Workflow** is ideal for teams that require structured collaboration, isolated development, and robust code review pipelines. It provides a scalable model for both small and large teams.

However, to prevent issues like merge conflicts and branch divergence, it’s important to **merge frequently** and **keep branches short-lived**.
